Virtual modular synthesizer engine

## Building

The build system is a mess, but I'll add instructions before I announce the software.

## License

All source code in this repository is licensed under the LGPLv3.

LGPL was chosen over GPL to allow plugins to call functions and inherit object classes from this source code without being forced to use the GPL license. You are thus free to develop proprietary plugins which link to and use the API of this software.
